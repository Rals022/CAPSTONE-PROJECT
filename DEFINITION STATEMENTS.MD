Definition Statement

I want to build an application that...... 
- Gives users/ customers the ability to do a survey digitally instead of filling out a physical form. this will increase the rate of return on surveys. Which in turn will give the company a better understanding on how the shop is doing. This will also save the company time becuase they won't have to manually enter survey data. 

Definition of Audience
- Target audience will be users who prefer to use their mobile phone or desktop to fill out the survey which is a faster process than filling the survey out and mailing in the survey after. 

Who is using my application
- Application will be used by customers/users. Application will also be used by the company to see each location avg survey score and rate of return and also breaking it down by each estimators indiviual score.
